## $`SZ_l`$ (odd modulus) experiments: solver + enumerator

This folder accompanies computational experiments and reproducibility notes for the manuscript “Orientations of 10-Edge-Connected Planar Graphs and Applications”. It contains two scripts (intended to live in the same directory):

- `szl_odd_solver.py`: an $SZ_l$ decision and $\beta$-orientation solver for **odd** modulus $l$.
- `generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py`: for a **given odd $l$**, enumerates 4-vertex, $3(l-1)$-edge (with multiplicity) undirected multigraphs under constraints (min degree $\ge l-1$, max multiplicity per pair $\le l-2$, connected), removes isomorphic duplicates, renders an overview figure, and tests each graph for $SZ_l$; for graphs that are not $SZ_l$, it prints **all** infeasible $\beta$.

This README is the **single main document**: it first explains how the two scripts fit together, then gives a detailed account of the mathematical modeling and the implementation workflow of each script (including DFS pruning and isomorphism reduction), so results can be reviewed and reproduced.

## 0. Recommended layout

Keep these files in the same directory:

- `szl_odd_solver.py`
- `generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py`
- `README_CN.md` (Chinese)
- `README.md` (this file, English)

`generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py` dynamically imports `szl_odd_solver.py` from the same directory to access `SZlOddSolver`, so they must be co-located unless you adjust the import path.

The file `nonisomorphic_4v12e_l5_overview.png` (or `nonisomorphic_4v*e_l*_overview.png` for other $l$) in the directory is an overview figure generated by running `generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py`. Readers can run the script with `--modulus l` to regenerate the figure for a given odd $l$.


---

## 1. Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `networkx`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

Install example:

```bash
python -m pip install networkx matplotlib numpy
```

---

## 2. Quickstart (recommended)

### 2.1 Run enumeration + overview figure + SZ_l testing

```bash
python generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py [--modulus l]
```

Default is $l=5$. Example for $l=7$: `python generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py --modulus 7`.

This will:

- open a Matplotlib window showing the overview grid (all non-isomorphic representatives)
- save an overview PNG to the current working directory:
  - `nonisomorphic_4v{3(l-1)}e_l{l}_overview.png` (e.g. `nonisomorphic_4v12e_l5_overview.png` for $l=5$)
- print $SZ_l$ testing results to the console; if a graph is not $SZ_l$, it prints **all** infeasible $\beta$ (as vectors).
- write the same run output to a results file in the current working directory: `nonisomorphic_4v{3(l-1)}e_l{l}_results.txt`, for later reference. Use `--no-log` to disable writing the results file; use `--no-show` to save the figure without opening the window.

### 2.2 Run the solver demo only

```bash
python szl_odd_solver.py
```

The script contains a built-in `main()` demo. You can edit `mod/n/edges/beta` to test different graphs and boundaries.

---

## 3. `szl_odd_solver.py`: problem statement

### 3.1 Valid boundaries $\beta$

Let $G$ be a connected undirected multigraph (parallel edges allowed, no self-loops) and let $l$ be a positive odd integer.

A function $\beta:V(G)\to\mathbb{Z}_l$ is a valid boundary if:

- $`\beta(v)\in\{0,1,\dots,l-1\}`$ for all $v$
- $\sum_{v\in V}\beta(v)\equiv 0\pmod l$

The sum condition is necessary since $\sum_v(\text{out}-\text{in})=0$ for any orientation.

### 3.2 $\beta$-orientation and $SZ_l$

A $\beta$-orientation is an orientation of all edges such that for each vertex $v$:

$$
(\mathrm{outdeg}(v)-\mathrm{indeg}(v))\equiv \beta(v)\pmod l
$$

The graph $G$ is $SZ_l$ if such an orientation exists for **every** valid boundary $\beta$.

---

## 4. `szl_odd_solver.py`: modeling (as implemented)

### 4.1 Bundling parallel edges: one integer $y$ per vertex pair

For an unordered pair $\{u,v\}$ (normalized as $u<v$) with multiplicity $k$, define an integer variable $`y\in\{0,1,\dots,k\}`$ as the number of edges oriented $u\to v$. Then:

- net contribution at $u$ (out-in) is $2y-k$
- net contribution at $v$ is $-(2y-k)$

Thus we search one integer variable per vertex pair (domain size $k+1$) rather than enumerating $2^k$ edge directions.

### 4.2 Signs and constant terms $C_v$

For each bundle $e=(u,v)$ (normalized $u<v$), define:

- $\mathrm{sign}(u,e)=+1$
- $\mathrm{sign}(v,e)=-1$

For each vertex:

$$
S(v)=\sum_{e\ni v}\mathrm{sign}(v,e)\cdot y_e
$$

Expanding $(2y_e-k_e)$ yields the congruence:

$$
C_v+2S(v)\equiv \beta(v)\pmod l,\qquad
C_v=\sum_{e\ni v}\mathrm{sign}(v,e)\cdot(-k_e)
$$

### 4.3 Odd modulus trick: divide by 2 in $\mathbb{Z}_l$

When $l$ is odd, 2 is invertible in $\mathbb{Z}_l$. Let $2^{-1}$ be its inverse. Then:

$$
S(v)\equiv 2^{-1}(\beta(v)-C_v)\pmod l
$$

In the code, the right-hand side is precomputed as `target_residue[v_idx]` (aligned with the sorted vertex list `vertices`).

## 5. `szl_odd_solver.py`: implementation workflow (by functions)

### 5.1 Core data structures

- `EdgeBundle(u, v, k)`: a normalized vertex pair with multiplicity $k$ (always `u < v`).
- `OddOrientationSolution`: stores a solution, including:
  - `y_by_pair[(u,v)]`: the $y$ value per bundle
  - `out_minus_in[v]`: integer out-in values (not reduced mod $l$)
  - `directions`: expanded per-edge directions `(tail, head)` (useful for verification/replay)

### 5.2 `SZlOddSolver.__init__`: preprocessing

Initialization performs:

- input validation (odd $l$, no self-loops, connected)
- `vertices = sorted(nodes)` and `index_of_vertex`
- bundle collection `_collect_edge_bundles()`
- sign structure `_build_signs()` (incident bundles and $\pm1$ per vertex)
- degree computation (counting multiplicity)
- constant term vector `C_vec`
- inverse `inv2 = 2^{-1} (mod l)`

### 5.3 `enumerate_betas()`: enumerate all valid $\beta$

For $n$ vertices, it enumerates the first $n-1$ values (there are $l^{n-1}$ choices) and determines the last value uniquely from $\sum\beta\equiv 0\pmod l$. This avoids a full $l^n$ enumeration.

### 5.4 `solve_for_beta(beta)`: DFS + Pruning (Core)

Overall workflow:

1. **Validity check**: verify vertex set matches; check that values are in the correct range; and ensure the total sum is 0 (mod $l$).  
2. **Compute target residues**: for each vertex, calculate `target_residue[v]`.  
3. **Establish variable domains**: for each edge bundle $e$, $`y_e \in \{0, \dots, k_e\}`$.  
4. **Variable ordering**: sort by domain size in ascending order (i.e., smaller $k_e$ first).  
5. **DFS search**:  
   - **State**: `partial_sum[v]` (current sum of the integer parts of $S(v)$ contributed by assigned variables)  
   - **Recursion**: for the current edge bundle, try each possible $y$ value, updating `partial_sum` for both endpoints.  
6. **Pruning (interval + modular reachability)**:  
   - For each vertex $v$, compute the reachable interval $[L,U]$ for $S(v)$ contributed by unassigned edge bundles.  
   - Compute `need ≡ target_residue[v] - partial_sum[v] (mod l)` and check whether there exists $t \in [L,U]$ such that $t \equiv \text{need} \pmod l$.  
   - Equivalently, check whether there exists an integer $q$ such that $L \le \text{need} + q l \le U$.  
   - If no such $q$ exists, backtrack (prune).  
7. **Termination and assembly**:  
   - After all variables are assigned, verify that all vertex residues are satisfied.  
   - Expand each edge bundle's $y$ value into individual edge directions (the first $y$ edges as $u\to v$, the remaining $k-y$ edges as $v\to u$).  
   - Finally, check that `out_minus_in[v] % l == beta[v]` for all vertices.


### 5.5 `is_SZl(...)`: decision and witness

Enumerate all valid $\beta$ and call `solve_for_beta`:

- if any $\beta$ is infeasible, return `(False, beta)` as a witness
- otherwise return `(True, None)`

The parameter `max_beta` can be used to truncate the enumeration during debugging.

### 5.6 `get_all_infeasible_betas(verbose=False, max_beta=None)`: collect all infeasible $\beta$

Enumerate all valid $\beta$ and return the **list** of all $\beta$ for which no $\beta$-orientation exists (used to output every counterexample for non-$SZ_l$ graphs).

---

## 6. `generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py`: what it does

This script packages “dataset generation + visualization + batch testing”. For a **given odd $l$** (default 5, via `--modulus`):

1. enumerate 4-vertex, $3(l-1)$-edge (with multiplicity) multigraphs under constraints: min degree $\ge l-1$, max multiplicity per pair $\le l-2$, connected
2. remove isomorphic duplicates (keep representatives)
3. draw and save an overview grid figure (PNG)
4. test each representative for $SZ_l$ using `SZlOddSolver(..., l)`; for graphs that are not $SZ_l$, print **all** infeasible $\beta$

---

## 7. `generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py`: implementation workflow

### 7.1 Exact enumeration space

For a given odd $l$, vertices are fixed as $`\{1,2,3,4\}`$. We consider the 6 unordered pairs:

$$
(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)
$$

For each pair, assign a multiplicity $`k_{uv}\in\{0,1,\dots,l-2\}`$ (max $l-2$ per pair) and filter by:

- total multiplicity:

$$
\sum k_{uv}=3(l-1)
$$

- minimum degree (counting multiplicity): for each vertex $v$,

$$
\mathrm{deg}(v)\ge l-1
$$
- connectivity of the underlying simple graph (treat $k_{uv}>0$ as an edge)

### 7.2 Isomorphism reduction: canonical key over all $4!$ permutations

The script implements a deterministic canonicalization:

- enumerate all $4!$ vertex permutations
- compute the induced 6-tuple under each permutation
- take the lexicographically smallest tuple as the canonical key
- deduplicate by this key

### 7.3 Plotting: consistent visual scale across subplots

With curved arc patches for parallel edges, Matplotlib can autoscale subplots differently, making some graphs look larger/smaller. The script fixes this by:

- using a fixed radial layout radius
- fixing `xlim/ylim` to the same range for every subplot

### 7.4 Output: overview PNG and results TXT

The script saves the overview figure to the current working directory:

- `nonisomorphic_4v{3(l-1)}e_l{l}_overview.png` (e.g. `nonisomorphic_4v12e_l5_overview.png` for $l=5$)

and writes the same run output (as printed to the console) to a results file in the same directory:

- `nonisomorphic_4v{3(l-1)}e_l{l}_results.txt` (e.g. `nonisomorphic_4v12e_l5_results.txt` for $l=5$)

Use `--no-log` to disable writing the results file. The script prints the saved paths for both the figure and the results file.

### 7.5 Batch $SZ_l$ testing and console output

For each representative:

- build an `nx.MultiGraph`
- call `SZlOddSolver(Gm, l).get_all_infeasible_betas(verbose=False)`
- if the list is non-empty (graph is not $SZ_l$), print:
  - graph index
  - edge multiplicities (6 pairs, sum $3(l-1)$)
  - vertex degrees
  - **all** infeasible $\beta$ as vectors in `solver.vertices` order, and the total count

---

## 8. Performance and reproducibility notes

- **Solver complexity**: the number of valid boundaries is $l^{n-1}$; each DFS is exponential in the worst case. This implementation targets small-to-moderate instances for experimental verification.
- **Determinism**:
  - `szl_odd_solver.py`: vertices and bundles are sorted; given the same input, search order and output are deterministic (when a solution exists)
  - `generate_nonisomorphic_4v_szl.py`: the canonical-key approach is fully deterministic
